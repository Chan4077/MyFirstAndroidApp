## A note before you contribute
Please take note that your commit will benefit me and whoever else is working on this repo. I can't be the only one working on this repository. You, too, can contribute to the hard work that I have put into this repo by commiting.
Note that your commit may affect the website in terms of design, loading and scripting. Therefore, you should fork [this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to help me make this project last.
Without your support, this would not be possible. Anyways, enough of the yabba gabba. On to the docs!
